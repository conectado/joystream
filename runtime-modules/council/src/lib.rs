// TODO: adjust all extrinsic weights

//! # Council module
//! Council module for the the Joystream platform.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Council module let's privileged network users elect their voted representation.
//!
//! Each council cycle is composed of three phases. The default phase is the candidacy announcement phase,
//! during which users can announce their candidacy to the next council. After a fixed amount of time
//! (network blocks) candidacy announcement phase concludes, and the next phase starts if a minimum
//! number of candidates is announced; restarts the announcement phase otherwise. The next phase
//! is the Election phase, during which users can vote for their selected candidate. The election
//! itself is handled by the Referendum module. After elections end and a minimum amount of candidates
//! received votes, a new council is appointed, and the Council module enters an Idle phase for the fixed
//! amount of time before another round's candidacy announcements begin.
//!
//! The module supports requiring staking currency for the both candidacy and voting.
//!
//! ## Implementation
//! Module expects that association of a particular account id to a membership id is never broken.
//! Reassociation of an account id to a different membership id behind the scenes that the Council module
//! can't be aware of will result in unexpected behavior.
//!
//! When implementing runtime for this module, don't forget to call all ReferendumConnection trait functions
//! at proper places. See the trait details for more information.
//!
//! ## Supported extrinsics
//! - [announce_candidacy](./struct.Module.html#method.announce_candidacy)
//! - [release_candidacy_stake](./struct.Module.html#method.release_candidacy_stake)
//! - [set_candidacy_note](./struct.Module.html#method.set_candidacy_note)
//! - [set_budget](./struct.Module.html#method.set_budget)
//!
//! ## Important functions
//! These functions have to be called by the runtime for the council to work properly.
//! - [recieve_referendum_results](./trait.ReferendumConnection.html#method.recieve_referendum_results)
//! - [can_release_vote_stake](./trait.ReferendumConnection.html#method.can_release_vote_stake)
//!
//! ## Dependencies:
//! - [referendum](../referendum/index.html)
//!
//! NOTE: When implementing runtime for this module, don't forget to call all ReferendumConnection
//!       trait functions at proper places.
